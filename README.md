# Pore Extractor 2D

## Description

## Installation

Pore Extractor 2D requires ImageJ FIJI version 1.53g or later distribution.
Downloads and system requirements can be found at: https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads

Unzip the download and extract the Fiji.app folder. If installing on Windows, the folder should be stored somewhere on the user space (e.g. Desktop, Documents), rather than in Program Files, to facilitate write permissions. 

ImageJ can be opened by clicking on the application within the Fiji.app folder.

The current version of Pore Extractor 2D should be installed from its ImageJ update site. This update site also automatically installs the Pore Analyzer tool dependencies BoneJ (Doube et al., 2010) and BioVoxxel Toolbox (Brocher, 2015). 

The user will be prompted to close and restart ImageJ several times during this installation process.
