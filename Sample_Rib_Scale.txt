To meet GitHub file upload limits of 100 MB, the rib images are downsized from the original 10x (1446 pixels/mm) image. 
Images were downsized with the Resize plugin (Least-Squares, Cubic Spline) from EPFL Biomedical Imaging Group: http://bigwww.epfl.ch/algorithms/ijplugins/resize/
Images were LZW compressed to >100 MB with the Bio-Formats Exporter: https://imagej.net/formats/bio-formats

To maximize image quality, images were generated as close to the 100 MB upload limit as possible
The original rib image had to be downsized to 47% of original size, as its whitespace contained more image data. 
All modified rib images could be downsized to 65% of the original size.
Please note that this size differential prevents ROIs generated from the original rib image from being superimposed on any modified rib images.

Original Rib Image: 680 pixels/mm

All Modified Rib Images: 940 pixels/mm
